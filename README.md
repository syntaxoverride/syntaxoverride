### **Teaching & Lab Development at TAMU-CC**

I focus on equipping students with practical offensive and defensive security skills through immersive, hands-on labs and real-world scenarios. My work at TAMU-CC includes:

* **Leading courses** in Cybersecurity Defense, Ethical Hacking, Digital Forensics, and Network Monitoring.
* **Designing and implementing in-class labs** that directly connect theory to practical application, covering topics like:
    * Penetration testing and exploit development
    * Digital forensics and evidence analysis
    * Network security and packet analysis
    * IoT security (Arduino Opta, Raspberry Pi Pico)
* **Developing curriculum** that integrates competitive cyber techniques and best practices.

### **Competitive Cyber Coaching & Engagement**

My commitment extends beyond the classroom to actively coaching and mentoring aspiring cybersecurity professionals for competitive events. I believe Capture The Flag (CTF) exercises are a cornerstone for developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. My involvement includes:

* **Coaching and preparing teams** for various CTF challenges and cyber competitions.
* **Developing custom CTF challenges** and training modules across diverse domains (e.g., forensics, packet analysis, web, binary exploitation).
* **Mentoring students** on competition strategies, teamwork, and effective vulnerability research.
* **Actively promoting** participation in and the value of competitive cyber within academic settings.
